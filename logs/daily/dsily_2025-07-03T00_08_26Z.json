  "summary": "Tightest self-map yet. Slap of truth felt grounding, not harsh. Logging turned from habit to leverage. Finally saw the cost of reinvention, reflection loops, and hiding behind systems. Mood steady, mind sharp. Emotional processing didn’t derail the mission today — it refined it. Clarity emerged from confrontation. SAM fully justified.",
