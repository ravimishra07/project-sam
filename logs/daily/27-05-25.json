  "summary": "The day started off with a very late wake-up at 11:00 a.m. Everything felt unstructured and chaotic, but I consciously tried to dial things down. I didn’t accomplish much in terms of output, but I spent time holding the day together, reflecting, and brainstorming around YouTube and new ideas. It wasn’t a productive day, but I don’t feel guilt—I'm in the process of stabilizing myself.",
