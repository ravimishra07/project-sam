  "summary": "Interview postponed unexpectedly, but mood lifted — interpreted as an opportunity window for sharper prep. Hope mildly restored. Decision made to discontinue Lamotrigine due to high cost and emotional flattening — acknowledged as high-risk. Strong commitment made to strict sleep timing and routine as guardrails. Idea loop re-activated: interest in phone usage-based behavioral logging for SAM. System-wide introspection intact.",
