  "summary": "Day marked by cognitive load and existential rumination. Focused on mental math foundations like squares, roots, and tables\u2014driven by a deep sense that calculation mastery might anchor future competence. Underneath, there's a low-burn fear of irrelevance and private job instability, triggering thoughts about government exams. Despite low mood and energy, progress was made. Emotional flatness persisted, but no breakdown.",
