  "title": "Extended Sleep, Calm Output, and Subsurface Stability",
  "summary": "Woke unusually late after 12+ hours of sleep. No signs of depression or emotional drag. Lithium and lorazepam were taken, but no lamotrigine. Energy level was low-voltage but emotionally clear. Mental state was slow but not fogged — reflections continued, video content reviewed, and visual AI prompt construction progressed. Suppressed content views were investigated without overreaction. Mood remained flat but functional. No impulsive activity, no craving spikes, no performance spiral. Calmness seen as integration phase, not collapse.",
