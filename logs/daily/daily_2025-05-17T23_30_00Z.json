  "title": "Containment Through Routine, Reflection Spiral Flagged, and Drift Held Gently",
  "summary": "Started day at 8:00 AM \u2014 anchor held. Video upload completed early. Watched T-34, which led to a reflective, system-mapping mental drift. Country analogies and global arcs were explored with creative intensity \u2014 flagged by system as emotionally charged but not destabilizing. Reframed those sessions as cognitive play rather than drift. Added strict routine blocks with deliberate friction. Decision framed as protective, not perfectionist. Explicit acknowledgment that structure is now serving the role previously handled by mood stabilizer buffer zones. No identity dislocation, but high introspective activity.",

    "Cognitive play is healthy if awareness holds the frame.",
    "Daily discipline like video upload acts as micro-proof of direction, even in high-drift days.",
    "Over-structuring is not a threat if treated like breath: returned to, not enforced.",
    "Emotional safety is now behavioral, not relational."
