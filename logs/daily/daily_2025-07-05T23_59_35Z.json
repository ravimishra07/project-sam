  "summary": "Day was emotionally heavy. Call with Banvi brought unresolved patterns back into view \u2014 emotional mismatch, repeated conflict, and final clarity on incompatibility. Spent much of the day refracting emotionally and cleaning code. Cursor workflow felt misaligned, leading to frustration. Mood was low despite effort. Felt detached and irritable. No major forward push on SAM or SpendMirror; internal re-alignment dominated.",
