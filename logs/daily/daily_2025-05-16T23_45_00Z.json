  "summary": "Interview postponed unexpectedly, but mood lifted \u2014 interpreted as an opportunity window for sharper prep. Hope mildly restored. Decision made to discontinue Lamotrigine due to high cost and emotional flattening \u2014 acknowledged as high-risk. Strong commitment made to strict sleep timing and routine as guardrails. Idea loop re-activated: interest in phone usage-based behavioral logging for SAM. System-wide introspection intact.",
