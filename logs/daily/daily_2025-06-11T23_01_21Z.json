  "summary": "Day marked by heavy emotional inertia, low energy despite adequate sleep. Major shift: starting new job in a few days, but no sense of joy. Processing deeper questions of identity, meaning, and what this phase of life represents. Tutor App briefly surged as a serious calling, then intentionally shelved \u2014 signaling awareness of current energy limits. Overall, a still-point in the journey \u2014 not action, but reflection.",
