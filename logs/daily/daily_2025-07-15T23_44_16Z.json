  "summary": "Woke up around 7:50 AM, went for a 1 km run and 1 km walk. Started work before office, but laptop screen went black. Reported it to IT at office and got a replacement; spent the day setting up environments. Had a rough interaction with Price (temporary manager), which added to the hectic day. Post-office, resolved Android Studio issue and completed assigned work. Couldn't focus on Tutor App due to disruptions. Also referred BlueSmart intern for a CQ interview; they may join tomorrow.",
