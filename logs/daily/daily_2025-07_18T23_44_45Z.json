  "summary": "Woke up late. Office was intense, stayed busy most of the day. Smoked more due to stress. Last night ordered food + cigarettes on Blinkit, overspending ₹500 — not great for finances. After work, made strong progress on Tutor app UI (used AI) and cleaned up Project SAM structure. Productive evening, but day came with cost: stress, spending, smoking.",
