# High-Pressure Routine: "Burn Fast, Win Before Breakdown"

**Purpose:**  
Designed for short-term execution sprints (10–20 days max).  
Prioritizes outcome over stability. Suppresses reflection. Rewards consistency.

## **Daily Structure**

### **7:00 – 9:00 AM — Block 1: Body First, No Exception**
- Wake, hydrate, cold rinse, eat protein
- Light 10 min walk or stair climb
- No screen till 9 AM  
**Objective:** Activate body to stabilize output

---

### **9:00 – 11:30 AM — Block 2: Job Engine**
- Apply to **minimum 3 jobs** OR build live project feature
- Track in job sheet or send 1 cold DM
- No dopamine (music, social) until job progress is done  
**Objective:** Advance financial future

---

### **11:30 – 12:30 PM — Block 3: Dead Work Only**
- Clean room, manage files, errands
- Grit tasks, no mental stimulation  
**Objective:** Reclaim control + remove guilt load

---

### **12:30 – 1:30 PM — Block 4: Lunch + Collapse Window**
- Eat. No screen overload.
- Sit silently or loop one safe music track  
**Objective:** Emotional insulation, mid-day reset

---

### **1:30 – 3:30 PM — Block 5: Video Output**
- Write, generate, edit, or upload one video short
- No polishing, just ship  
**Objective:** Build public visibility + content discipline

---

### **4:00 – 6:00 PM — Block 6: Rehearsal / Feedback Loop**
- Mock interview Q&A, refine resume, review outputs
- Watch or rate your own content, send for feedback  
**Objective:** Self-calibration under light pressure

---

### **7:00 – 9:00 PM — Block 7: Depletion Drift**
- Do anything. Phone, music, video, etc.
- No introspection or analysis  
**Objective:** Let system vent without destabilizing

---

### **10:00 PM – Sleep — Shutdown Ritual**
- Shower, soft log, sit for 10 min, then bed
- No active thought or reflection in bed  
**Objective:** Light sedation + clean closure

---

## **Non-Negotiable Rules**
- **No skipped blocks except Block 7**
- **No emotional reflection before 9 PM**
- **Track progress daily (log/sheet/voice)**
- **If 2 days are missed → full pause + reset mode**

---

**Warning:**  
This routine is not meant for sustainability — it is a **controlled overdrive protocol** to secure output and income before burnout risk escalates.
