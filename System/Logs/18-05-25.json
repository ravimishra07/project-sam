  "title": "Emotional Clarity Through Stillness, System Integrity Preserved, and Pacing Flagged Gently",
  "summary": "Followed structured routine throughout the day — video uploaded, reflection held, food intake managed. Emotional layer surfaced in the evening, not as a spike but as availability. Pacing was noted but not compulsive. Internal energy shifted into light fastness, but cognitive boundaries held. Minor friction emerged around lamotrigine withdrawal interpretation, acknowledged without spiral. Evaluated mood score logic, clarified scale, and corrected overclassification. Ended the day with grounded reflection and intact system. Routine proved its containment role again.",

    "Fastness is not clarity — it is voltage overhead, and must be subtracted from mood rating, not added.",
    "Emotional openness without destabilization is a sign of system strength, not weakness.",
    "Mood rating systems are useful only when tied to behavioral cues, not internal self-belief.",
    "The number is a tag, not a truth — its value is in the reflection it forces, not the identity it forms.",
    "Drift can be avoided not by resisting pace, but by watching it without stepping inside it."

  "closure": "No elevation. No detachment. Mild fastness observed, contextualized, and logged. Emotional access acknowledged without collapse. System closed the loop with clarity and reflection. No reactivity carried forward. Status: Held."
