  "title": "Interview Pulse, Tanvi Re-entry, and Internal Balancing",
  "summary": "A layered day with emotional events and tactical restraint. Interview scheduling lifted mood slightly. Unexpected meeting with Tanvi triggered warmth but no impulsive re-engagement. Calm presence maintained. Post-meeting mood remained steady but energy flattened. Attempted to study, but productivity was mood-driven, not standard-driven. Ended day with deep introspection about manic drift vs. self-punishment pattern. No spirals, but high alert self-awareness. Clarity intact.",

    "Tanvi’s change was acknowledged, not absorbed.",
    "Studying was mood-anchored, not will-driven — a flag for system friction."
