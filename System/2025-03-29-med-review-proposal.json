    "notes": "This log formalizes Ravi\u2019s request for a structured med-free trial with psychiatric support. It is grounded in current emotional stability, low external stress, and high self-awareness. The proposal clearly separates rebellion from responsibility, and includes backup systems for safety. It reflects mature autonomy in managing a serious mental health condition."
