✅ 30-Second Shorts: Execution Checklist (Max: 3 Hours)

⸻

⏱️ PHASE 1: SCRIPTING (1 Hour Max)

🔹 [ ] Define goal of video
	•	What’s the payoff? (e.g. “Drive clicks to Prompt Pack”)

🔹 [ ] Write HOOK (0–3s)
	•	One sentence
	•	Max 10–12 words
	•	Stop the scroll

🔹 [ ] Write CORE (3–20s)
	•	State pain → deliver value
	•	Show how AI/Prompt/Idea solves it
	•	No fluff words
	•	Each line = one visual

🔹 [ ] Write CTA (20–30s)
	•	Contrast → Confidence → Command
	•	e.g.

Most people ask bad prompts.  
I don’t. Prompt Pack’s in the bio. Use it.



⸻

⏱️ PHASE 2: VOICE + AUDIO (30 Min Max)

🔹 [ ] Paste final script into ElevenLabs

🔹 [ ] Fix all pronunciation:
	•	GPT = “Gee-pee-tee”
	•	ITR = “Eye-tee-are”
	•	CA = “Chartered Accountant” or “See-ay”

🔹 [ ] Remove all awkward pauses

🔹 [ ] Export final MP3

→ Should be 26–27 seconds max

⸻

⏱️ PHASE 3: VISUALS (1.5 Hours Max)

🔹 [ ] Select base template (e.g. Portal Tech P90)

🔹 [ ] Split visual beats by audio timeline (3s per scene)

🔹 [ ] For each block:
	•	Text overlay = bold, large, center
	•	Background = motion, not static
	•	Font = Bebas Neue / Anton
	•	CTA = Button-style or glowing card

🔹 [ ] Upload voiceover and sync scene cuts

⸻

⏱️ PHASE 4: FINAL POLISH (15 Min Max)

🔹 [ ] Watch once with subtitles

→ Any awkward pauses, empty frames = fix

🔹 [ ] Add thumbnail title (optional)

🔹 [ ] Export @ 1080x1920 MP4

🔹 [ ] Upload + Add caption, CTA comment pinned

💥 Export Rule:

If you’re tweaking after 3 hours — you’re not improving. You’re hiding.
