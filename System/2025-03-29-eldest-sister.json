    "notes": "This log captures a pivotal trauma thread: the abuse from Ravi\u2019s eldest sister, misinterpretation of bipolar symptoms as violence, and subsequent physical assault and misdiagnosis. It ends with emotional collapse and his mother\u2019s death. It is meant to be preserved as an anchor memory file \u2014 not to inspire, but to protect truth from being forgotten or rewritten by guilt, forgiveness, or denial."
