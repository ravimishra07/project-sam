# 🧠 Weekly Reflection – Sunday Check-in

## 1. Emotional Dump (raw thoughts, stress, pride, fear):
- 

## 2. Identity Anchor:
- Did I act in alignment with my long-term self?
- 

## 3. Execution Reflection:
- What did I actually complete this week?
- What slipped or felt stuck?

## 4. Emotional Stability:
- Any spikes? Triggers? Moments of stillness?

## 5. Recalibration (next week’s adjustment):
- What to drop? What to continue? What to start?

### 🔁 Sam Mode Reminder:
If your emotional or mental state shifts, remember you can switch Sam’s behavior:

- `Switch to work buddy mode` → Focus only, no emotion
- `Switch to emotional buddy mode` → Gentle support, no pressure
- `Switch to all mode` → Balanced mode with memory, logic, emotion

See `System/sam_mode_switch.md` for full protocol.
