  "title": "Unexpected Spark from AI Guy",
  "data": "Today I casually met someone new in the office — turned out he's part of the AI team and has done a formal postgrad in AI. Something about that clicked deep. It wasn’t about him personally, but what he represented: proof that the AI work here is real, valid, and inside reach. I felt genuinely excited — like a door I thought was locked might actually be open. It pulled me to rethink where I’m going. For the first time, transitioning to an AI role didn’t feel like a far-off plan — it felt near, possible, even natural. This wasn’t anxiety-driven. It felt like healthy hunger, the kind that signals a new arc is forming. I didn’t expect it, but now I can’t unsee it.",
