  "summary": "A layered day of emotional and strategic self-inquiry. Explored internal conviction about being exceptional \u2014 emotionally and logically \u2014 and questioned whether it's grounded or delusional. Came out with stronger confidence in inner truth, but also recognized hidden entitlement. Parallelly, re-evaluated AI-focused roles and job paths; rejected shallow job opportunities not aligned with deep creative or systems thinking. The day rebalanced identity with ambition, truth with patience, and ego with output.",
