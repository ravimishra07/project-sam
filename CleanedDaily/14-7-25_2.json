  "summary": "Energy is returning after a long low. Not sure if it's meds or cycle, but it's rising\u2014need to watch ceiling. Able to work again, finished Firebase CMS mostly (realized I had already done bulk earlier). Mental cohesion coming back. Office had a slight patch with manager, but didn't spiral. Work\u2019s on track. Tutor app looks real\u2014maybe even profitable\u2014but not attaching to that yet. Feeling better, not manic, just stable with mild hope.",
