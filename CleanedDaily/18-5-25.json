  "summary": "Followed structured routine throughout the day \u2014 video uploaded, reflection held, food intake managed. Emotional layer surfaced in the evening, not as a spike but as availability. Pacing was noted but not compulsive. Internal energy shifted into light fastness, but cognitive boundaries held. Minor friction emerged around lamotrigine withdrawal interpretation, acknowledged without spiral. Evaluated mood score logic, clarified scale, and corrected overclassification. Ended the day with grounded reflection and intact system. Routine proved its containment role again.",
