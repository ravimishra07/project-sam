  "summary": "A mentally turbulent day marked by emotional turbulence, panic attacks, and a resurfacing of old relationship wounds. While office work continued outwardly, internally the day was shaped by deep personal disturbance and a sense of futility. A conflict with Tanvi triggered a chain of emotional events, including suicidal ideation and feelings of helplessness. Despite the chaos, some grounding reflections and physical execution were maintained.",
