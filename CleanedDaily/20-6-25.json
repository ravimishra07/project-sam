  "summary": "First real day at Wiom. Despite the mental strain of performance expectations and the long commute, energy was moderately stable. Social confidence is still a work in progress, but key wins include initiating conversations, building camaraderie, and managing emotional baseline throughout the day. Some anxiety around voice expression and eye contact remains, but no spirals or major distortions noted.",
