  "summary": "A layered day with emotional events and tactical restraint. Interview scheduling lifted mood slightly. Unexpected meeting with Tanvi triggered warmth but no impulsive re-engagement. Calm presence maintained. Post-meeting mood remained steady but energy flattened. Attempted to study, but productivity was mood-driven, not standard-driven. Ended day with deep introspection about manic drift vs. self-punishment pattern. No spirals, but high alert self-awareness. Clarity intact.",
