  "summary": "Faced the first round of Unacademy interview today. Performance was rated as average \u2014 neither strong nor disqualifying. Accepted the outcome without emotional overreaction. Scheduled for the second round tomorrow. Overall energy felt better compared to recent weeks, possibly due to Lamotrigine effect. Managed to study and reflect without major drift. Routine held. No identity agitation.",
