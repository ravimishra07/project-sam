  "summary": "Past 3 weeks have been hectic. Sleep\u2019s been trash \u2014 last night only got 3 hours again. Work pressure nonstop, manager's behavior just added to the mental load. He lashed out over a bug that wasn\u2019t even real, didn\u2019t own up, just redirected anger to something else. I stayed calm, didn\u2019t react \u2014 could\u2019ve exploded, but I held it. After the fight, brain was stable but body and nerves still drained. That said, I had a long, solid chat with ChatGPT about AI jobs. Started from a place of confusion and ended with actual direction. Figured out that AI job market is full of fluff, but there\u2019s a niche I can own: building local, on-device tools that solve real pain in India. And from that, we refined and landed on a powerful idea: FormMate \u2014 an offline form-filling assistant for Indian users, especially middle-class/lower-income. That idea\u2019s now locked as a secondary project. Derap stays the primary mission. Ideas are coming together, but my bandwidth is burning out. Hoping tomorrow isn't another fire.",
